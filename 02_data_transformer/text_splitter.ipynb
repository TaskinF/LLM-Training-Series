Traders and developers coded instructions based on technical indicators - such as relative strength index, moving averages - to automate long or short orders. A significant pivotal shift in algorithmic trading as machine learning was adopted. Specifically deep reinforcement learning (DRL) which allows systems to dynamically adapt to its current market conditions. Unlike previous models, DRL uses simulations to train algorithms. Enabling them to learn and optimize its algorithm iteratively. A 2022 study by Ansari et al, showed that DRL framework “learns adaptive policies by balancing risks and reward, excelling in volatile conditions where static systems falter”. This self-adapting capability allows algorithms to market shifts, offering a significant edge over traditional algorithmic trading. \\nComplementing DRL, directional change (DC) algorithms represent another advancement on core market events rather than fixed time intervals. A 2023 study by Adegboye, Kampouridis, and Otero explains that “DC algorithms detect subtle trend transitions, improving trade timing and profitability in turbulent markets”. DC algorithms detect subtle trend transitions such as uptrend, reversals, improving trade timing and profitability in volatile markets. This approach specifically captures the natural flow of market movement from higher high to lows.\\nIn practice, the DC algorithm works by defining two trends: upwards or downwards, which are triggered when a price moves beyond a certain threshold followed by a confirmation period(overshoot). This algorithm structure allows traders to pinpoint the stabilization of trends with higher accuracy. DC aligns trades with volatile, unstable market rhythms. By aligning trades with basic market rhythms, DC enhances precision, especially in volatile markets where traditiona\"),\n",

Other complaints against HFT include the argument that some HFT firms scrape profits from investors when index funds rebalance their portfolios.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe rapid-fire computer-based HFT developed gradually since 1983 after NASDAQ introduced a purely electronic form of trading. At the turn of the 21st century, HFT trades had an execution time of several seconds, whereas by 2010 this had decreased to milli- and even microseconds. At that time, high-frequency trading was still a little-known topic outside the financial sector, with an article published by the New York Times in July 2009 being one of the first to bring the subject to the public's attention.\\nOn September 2, 2013, Italy became the world's first country to introduce a tax specifically targeted at HFT, charging a levy of 0.02% on equity transactions lasting less than 0.5 seconds.\\n\\n\\n=== Market growth ===\\nIn the early 2000s, high-frequency trading still accounted for fewer than 10% of equity orders, but this proportion was soon to begin rapid growth. According to data from the NYSE, trading volume grew by about 164% between 2005 and 2009 for which high-frequency trading might be accounted. As of the first quarter in 2009, total assets under management for hedge funds with high-frequency trading strategies were $141 billion, down about 21% from their peak before the worst of the crises, although most of the largest HFTs are actually LLCs owned by a small number of investors.  The high-frequency strategy was first made popular by Renaissance Technologies who use both HFT and quantitative aspects in their trading. Many high-frequency firms are market makers and provide liquidity to the market which lowers volatility and helps narrow bid–offer spreads, making trading and investing cheaper for other market participants.\\n\\n\\n=== Market share ===\\nIn the United States in 2009, high-frequency trading firms represented 2% of the approximately 20,000 firms operating today, but accounted for 73% of all equity orders volume. The major U.S. high-frequency trading firms include Virtu Financial, Tower Research Capital, IMC, Tradebot, Akuna Capital and Citadel LLC. The Bank of England estimates similar percentages for the 2010 UK market share, also suggesting that in Europe HFT account\")]"

We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.\\n\\nJust because we fight without rancor and without selfish object, seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.\\n\\nâ€¦\\n\\nIt will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity toward a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck. We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between usâ€”however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts.\\n\\nWe have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendshipâ€”exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions toward the millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy who live among us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it toward all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in the hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.\\n\\nIt is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our heartsâ€”for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.\\n\\nTo such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured.
